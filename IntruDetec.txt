IP port detection Keywords:
"line printers" & "recorders" on all incoming ports to capture "keystrokes"
"traffic print-out" with the help of a Lan and a offline logbook of activities.

intruder entered via X.25 ports,  so we recorded bidirectional traffic through that set of lines
Off-line monitors have several advantages over monitors embedded in an operating system

RS-232 serial lines can easily be sent to multiple receivers, we used this type of off-line monitor and avoided tampering with our operating systems.

We noticed that line noise, which appeared to be network glitches, could be inserted into the communications link.

When the intruder transferred files, we timed round-trip packet acknowledgments over the network links. Later, we measured the empirical delay times to a variety of different sites and estimated average network delay times as a function of distance.
